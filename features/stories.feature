As a project manager, I want
  To create a project so that project members can collaborate and see progress with pManagr
  To create a general tasklist so that I lay out what needs to be done to complete the project.
  To create subtasks under tasks so that I lay out what specifically needs to be done
  To invite people to join the project so that people can collaborate on the project
  To create events so that the members can meet to discuss the project
  To assign tasks/subtasks off the tasklist to members so that everyone knows what they are supposed to be doing.
  To set milestones for tasks so that the project will complete on time
  To set deadlines for subtasks so that the members will have a general guide to completion.
  To get email notifications upon completion of tasks so that I have a general idea of progress.
  To set priorities for tasks/subtasks so that everyone knows which tasks are more important
  
As a project member, I want
  To be able to add subtasks to the task that I am responsible for so that tasks can be added as needed
  To be able to view the tasks that have been completed so that I know the progress of all members
  To be able to flag tasks or subtasks that I am having trouble with so that others know and can help out if possible
  To be able to discuss with other members through pManagr so that we can communicate about what weâ€™ve done or need to be done
  To be able to mark off whether or not a task/subtask is complete so that everyone knows where I stand
  To be able to undo a task/subtask completion so that if things need to be added or changed, we have that flexibility
